# ToDo
Just things that might be developed for **harpy**. 

SlaterByStrings - is an implementation of slater determinants using a string representation rather than a bit implementation. Implemented in **harpy** in fci.py module. Used in fci, cisd and ciss subroutines. Full CI implemented and access to G, S, D, T and Q exciations. Appears efficient. Combinations implemented by custom routines rather than scipy.special.

maths - are maths routines from my Gambas SCF program, stand-alone Boys, Jacobi, lancoz, QR diagonalisation, factorial, double factorial, Denman-Beavers (matrix root) etc

spherical - spherical to\from cartesian transformations

transitionDipoles - note on implementing TDHF properties.
