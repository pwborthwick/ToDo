## Hugenholtz Diagrams

The perturbation series for the ground state energy can be given by diagrams in the Hugenholtz vein constructed according to the following rules 
For an *n*<sup>th</sup> order diagram, n dots (vertices) are drawn in a column. Thesvertices are connected by directed lines subject to the conditions
1. Each vertex has two lines pointing in and two pointing out
2. Each diagram is connected, i.e.  one must be able to go from any one vertexto any other by following some number of lines
3. No line connects a vertex with itself
4. Each diagram is topologically distinct
